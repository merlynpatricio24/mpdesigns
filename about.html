				<h1> Hello there! </h1>

				<p> As someone who loves figuring out how things work and how people think, I am always curious about the things around me and am constantly trying to figure out how to make things better and more enjoyable for me and for others. </p>

				<p>Through UX design, I am able to understand customers on a deeper level and am able to improve the experience that the business provides which will ultimately help the business achieve its goals.</p>
				
				<p>My expertise lies in the core UX strategy and being able to translate these ideas into effective UI designs that are both seemless for the user as well as easy to learn. I have experience in designing for both mobile and web and can adapt to the needs of the team.</p>

					<h3>STRATEGY</h3>
					<p>Involves goal setting and expectation setting with the entire team and client. Inquiry of overall business strategies, objectives, and member roles. This phase focuses on making sure everyone is on the same page and understands what we want to achieve for all stakeholders. Strategy involves updating the plans if necessary. Considering that people often have different ideas when it comes to the actual product, it is my role to be able to streamline all of those ideas into one vision that is shared by everyone. By doing so, we are able to have a unified concept which will greatly help the team in the next parts of the design process.</p>

				<i class="icon-magnifying-glass medium-icon"></i>
					<h3>RESEARCH</h3>
					<p>Involves use of data acquisition methods such as interviews, card sorting, surveys, and observations. Various tools and methods are used in this phase depending on the need. The entire focus is to gather as much information about the market, product, and its competitors in order to create smarter decisions regarding the product and making sure we are on point with our designs in relation to our goals.</p>

				<i class="icon-bargraph medium-icon"></i>
					<h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
					<p>Using tools to understand the business problem and other factors through User Personas, Journey Maps, Site-mapping, Competitive Audit, etc. The focus of this phase is to be able to squeeze out insight from the research phase and find the key problems that affect the experience of the user as well as build on the strengths of the product. It is to focus on finding patterns that help validate or challenge our key assumptions about our product, market, and company.</p>

				<i class="icon-layers medium-icon"></i>
					<h3>DESIGN</h3>
					<p>In this phase, all these patterns and insights will be converted into the expected output of design. This phase involves the construction of wireframes, mockups, and prototypes grounded on data. In this phase rapid failure is essential to be able to recover quickly and improve from the previous iteration. It is essential to have close communication with the business adopting an agile methodology.</p>

				<i class="icon-beaker medium-icon"></i>
					<h3>BETA TEST</h3>
					<p>With the product taking on form, rapid beta testing is essentail to validate the designs in order to iterate without acquiring much costs. Through the new insight gathered, necessary chances can be made without taking too much damage from the business side.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 wow bounceIn" data-wow-delay="0.1s">
				<i class="icon-search medium-icon"></i>
					<h3>EVALUATE</h3>
					<p>Based on the user insight gathered from the beta tests, rapid iterations can be made to be able to have a stronger and better product from the previous one. This phase is all about learning from the users and figuring out what to do in the future to be able to constantly improve the product. It is essential to find deeper implications of the design made making sure that everything is well thought out. </p>

				<i class="icon-hotairballoon medium-icon"></i>
					<h3>LAUNCH</h3>
					<p>Once everyone is confident in the initial product, it's launch comes after. In this phase, the work is far from over as this is the time that monitor and control are vital activities in order to succeed. In this phase, we observe how the market is reacting to the product through various tools such as Google Analytics to be able to see if the company is getting closer to achieving its goals. Changes are then made to adjust accordingly to what works and what doesn't. This is an ongoing process of improvment and learning for everyone.</p>
